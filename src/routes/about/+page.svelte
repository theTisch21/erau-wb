<h1>About this</h1>
<p>
	Hello!<br />Let's be honest, weight and balance is <em>tedious</em>. I
	created an excel sheet a while back to make it easier. Over time, I kept adding new features, like
	the ability to automatically pull the empty weight and moment from each aircraft, and the ability
	to easily do the change aircraft calculations. I've gotten a lot of requests for the sheet, and
	not everyone is excel-savvy, so I created this web tool to make it easy to use. Using a web tool
	also allows me to do things like validate that the aircraft is not overweight, check that the
	moment is within limits, and it can work on any device without setup.
