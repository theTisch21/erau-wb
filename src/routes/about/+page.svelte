<h1>About this</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Sam (he/him), a student studying Aeronautical Science Fixed Wing at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott. <br>Let's be honest, weight and balance is <em>hard</em>. I created an excel sheet a while back to make it easier. Over time, I kept adding new features, like the ability to automatically pull the empty weight and moment from each aircraft, and the ability to easily do the change aircraft calculations. I've gotten a lot of requests for the sheet, and not everyone is excel-savvy, so I created this web tool to make it easy to use. Using a web tool also allows me to do things like validate that the aircraft is not overweight, check that the moment is within limits, and it can work on any device without setup.</p>
