<h1>About this</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Sam (he/him), a student studying Aeronautical Science Fixed Wing at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott. <br>Let's be honest, weight and balance is <em>hard</em>. I created an excel sheet a while back to make it easier. Over time, I kept adding new features, like the ability to automatically pull the empty weight and moment from each aircraft, and the ability to easily do the change aircraft calculations. I've gotten a lot of requests for the sheet, and not everyone is excel-savvy, so I created this web tool to make it easy to use.</p>
